# Customer Churn Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks

This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict customer churn using structured customer data. The objective is to identify customers who are likely to leave a service based on demographic, behavioral, and financial attributes.

## 📊 Dataset
The project uses the **Churn_Modelling.csv** dataset, which includes the following features:
- Credit score
- Geography
- Gender
- Age
- Tenure
- Account balance
- Number of products
- Credit card ownership
- Activity status
- Estimated salary
- Target label: **Exited** (customer churn)

## 🧠 Model Overview
- Data preprocessing:
  - Categorical feature encoding
  - Feature scaling
  - Train-test split
- Model:
  - Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- Framework:
  - TensorFlow / Keras
- Task:
  - Binary classification (Churn vs No Churn)
